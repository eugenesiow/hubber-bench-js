# Hubber Micro Performance Benchmarks (Javascript)

This is the Javascript part of the Hubber Micro Performance Benchmark Suite. 

Systems tested are:
* Selective-pub MQTT
* Selective-pub Deepstream
* Selective-sub MQTT
* Selective-sub Deepstream

Any dataset of the right graph format is supported but we use 2 datasets from Leskovec et al. from Stanford SNAP:
* arXiv General Relativity sparse, undirected collaboration network with 5242 nodes and 14496 edges
* Wikipedia who-votes-on-whom dense, directed network with 7115 nodes and 103689 edges
